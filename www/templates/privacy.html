This Statement describes your rights regarding our collection, use, storage, sharing, and protection of your personal information. It applies to the BIZITOGO Site, and all related sites, applications, services, and tools where this Statement is referenced and under direct control of BIZITOGO regardless of how you access or use them, including mobile devices.

        <p>Please direct questions regarding this statement to info@bizitogo.com</p>
        <h4>When does BIZITOGO collect my personal information?</h4>
        <p>BIZITOGO gathers information from users in four ways: voluntary registration, cookies, web beacon technology and log files.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Voluntary Registration.</strong> When you register with BIZITOGO, we ask for certain necessary personal information. Other specific services may have additional registration requirements and may require you to provide additional information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cookies.</strong>
             When you access our websites, or use our applications and/or services and tools, we may place small data files on your computer or other device known as a “cookie”. BIZITOGO uses a browser cookie to remember your login name (but not your password), as a reminder to assist you the next time you log on to our Site. A cookie helps the Site to recall your specific information or subsequent visits in order to simplify the process of delivering relevant content and ease site navigation. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this or other websites that depend on cookies.
        </p>
        <p>You may also encounter cookies from third parties, known as service providers, that we have allowed on our site that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services. BIZITOGO maintains no control over these third party cookies that you may encounter.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Web Beacons.</strong>
            BIZITOGO may use electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. BIZITOGO may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Log Files.</strong>
            BIZITOGO may also log standard information about your visit, including your IP address, browser type and language, access times, referring website addresses, the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Site for the purposes of systems administration or to report information in aggregate form to our advertisers, sponsors, and corporate partners.
        </p>
        <h4>How is my personally identifiable information used?</h4>
        <p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Site.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Customized Look and Feel.</strong>
            We use your volunteered information, cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide a customized look and feel and personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic patterns, demographics, users' preferences, and other information in the aggregate; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Email.</strong>
            If you register with our Site, from time to time, BIZITOGO may email you with informative messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you.
        </p>
        <h4>With whom does BIZITOGO share information?</h4>
        <p>BIZITOGO takes our commitment to your privacy seriously. When you provide personal information, we will only use it for its intended purpose. We will not sell, lease, share or redistribute the information we receive from you outside of BIZITOGO, its subsidiaries or agents. We do not supplement the data you provide to use with information provided by third parties.</p>
        <p>BIZITOGO may share user information with specific third parties for the purpose of providing additional services. In particular, BIZITOGO has several service partners who provide services or products and as part of such operations, these companies may be provided certain of your contact information. In addition, BIZITOGO also discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services and to reach prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. However, aggregate data is not traceable to you specifically. Except for these situations, we will not disclose your personal information to any third parties except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service or under circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation or legal process requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights.</p>
        <p>Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Statement (if any) may be found in the Terms of Use or privacy policies applicable to that particular service. To the extent that you are notified of uses of your personal information which are different from those described in this Statement during your enrollment in any particular service, the uses of which you are specifically notified will govern that service. Please note, however, that we do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers and other third party sites to which we provide banner ads and links. If you click through a banner ad or link and submit your information to an advertiser, you will be subject to their own privacy policies. BIZI	TOGO assumes no responsibility or liability for these third party policies or the actions of non-affiliated third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
        <p><strong>We may also share your personal information with:</strong></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> - Service providers under contract who help with our business operations.</li>
            <li> - Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We may disclose non-public personal information to unrelated parties in special cases when we have reason to believe that that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a person or persons who may be causing injury to, or interference with, the rights or property of BIZITOGO (including the Site), computer users accessing the Site, or any third party. In addition, we may disclose information about individuals who access the Site to law enforcement agencies, judicial or government authorities, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.</p>
        <h4>How We Protect and Store Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US where our facilities are located. We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
        <p>We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and we provide you with the opportunity to update your information through your account profile settings. We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce the Terms of Use and take other actions permitted by law.</p>
